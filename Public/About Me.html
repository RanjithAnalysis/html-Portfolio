     <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, this is Ranjith. I am a web developer by profession and a math teacher by passion. I have been teaching math <br /> 
      to students of classes 7-10 for the past 6 years. I have made math easier for students who thought it was a nightmare.<br />
      I teach in a very simple and effective way, guiding students through the fascinating world of numbers and equations. <br />
      Each day has been a journey of discovery, helping young minds grasp complex concepts and develop critical thinking <br />
      skills. This experience has not only honed my teaching abilities but also deepened my passion for education and <br />
      commitment to making math accessible and enjoyable for all.
    </p>
